# Project for processing Aglink results, data and the master file for the Medium-term Outlook (MTO)

## Files

-   process_Aglink_results.R: filters the big results cube and prepares a smaller subset to be copied to the viewer
-   milk_yields.R: checks milk yield trends in the Master File
-   complete_balancesheet.R: performs additional calculations to get the missing items in the balance sheet we publish (e.g. waste and FO for the individual Fresh Dairy Products)
